# Music genre classifier

This project will be completed in two parts:

* **Part 1**: I will write and submit a 1-page proposal document describing my plans for developing my musical genre classifier. This proposal should also demonstrate that I have explored the dataset and understood the problem. DUE 29 Mar

* **Part 2**: Following my proposal,  I will develop and evaluate two musical genre classifiers:
My custom solution, entirely trained on the datasets provided
A ‘baseline solution’ that uses a pre-trained classifier and fine-tunes it on the musical genre classification task using transfer learning
DUE 7 Apr


**Problem breakdown**
Information from TA: Use the audio dataset (.wav files). How are we transforming the signals? Downloading the CSV files of the signals is prohibited and will be penalized. 

The task at hand (Part 1): Familiarize with the audio dataset and create the plan for developing a musical classifier. 
Dataset: GTZAN with the audio files (Found online on Kaggle at: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andradaolteanu/gtzan-dataset-music-genre-classification/data)
Dataset Exploration
Do some exploration on the dataset of your choice:
•    What is the dataset like?
•    Is it balanced?
•    Can you show how many samples and how many classes there are?
•    And/or any other pieces of information you can provide.
Create a plan for developing your musical genre classifier.
After finalizing the dataset and dataset explorations:
•    Create a plan of how you will develop your musical genre classifier (include any preprocessing you will do, train/validation/test set splits, loss functions and other hyperparameters, performance metrics you will use, etc.).
•    Choose one pre-trained baseline model that will be fine-tuned on the musical genre classification task using transfer learning.
o    Reminder: you are going to compare your model to this one in Part 2 of the assignment
•    Predict how your model will perform compared to your pre-trained model (maybe in terms of speed, performance, etc.)
•    Write your one-page proposal! (details below)


Deliverables:
At least one plot for the dataset to show exploration (includes xx classes, imbalanced because of XYZ). 
Model architecture: How will the model be developed and evaluated? 
The baseline model (pre-trained model) will be fine-tuned.
How will performance be measured? Prediction on which model will perform best.
