# Music genre classifier

This project will be completed in two parts:

* **Part 1**: I will write and submit a 1-page proposal document describing my plans for developing my musical genre classifier. This proposal should also demonstrate that I have explored the dataset and understood the problem. DUE 29 Mar

* **Part 2**: Following my proposal,  I will develop and evaluate two musical genre classifiers:
My custom solution, entirely trained on the datasets provided
A ‘baseline solution’ that uses a pre-trained classifier and fine-tunes it on the musical genre classification task using transfer learning
DUE 7 Apr
